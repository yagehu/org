Indexed type families, or *type families* for short, are a Haskell
extension supporting ad-hoc overloading of data types. Type families
are parametric types that can be assigned specialized representations
based on the type parameters they are instantiated with. They are the
data type analogue of [[id:fbb01636-4139-4a7d-8031-b60a6b1341ac][type classes]]: families are used to define
overloaded data in the same way that classes are used to define
overloaded functions.

Type families come in two flavors: [[id:34030bb5-b38e-4fbd-87b8-30f0e6005ac5][/data families/]] and /type synonym
families/.
