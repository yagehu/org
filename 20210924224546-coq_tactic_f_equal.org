#+title: Coq tactic f_equal

Given a goal of the form =f a1 ... an = g b1 ... bn=, the tactic
=f_equal= will produce subgoals of the form =f = g=, =a1 = b1=, ...,
=an = bn=. At the same time, any of these subgoals that are simple
enough (e.g., immediately provable by =reflexivity=) will be
automatically discharged by =f_equal=.
