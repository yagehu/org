#+title: Coq tactic discriminate

The =discriminate= tactic embodies the principle of disjointness,
which says that two terms beginning with different constructors (like
=O= and =S=, or =true= and =false= can never be equal. It is used on a
hypothesis involving an equality between different constructors (e.g.,
=false = true=), and it solves the current goal immediately.

* Example

#+BEGIN_SRC coq
  Theorem discriminate_ex :
    forall (n m : nat), false = true -> n = m.
  Proof.
    intros n contra.
    discriminate contra.
  Qed.
