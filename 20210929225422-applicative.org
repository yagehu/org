#+title: =Applicative=

The =Applicative= [[id:fbb01636-4139-4a7d-8031-b60a6b1341ac][typeclass]] allows for function application lifted
over structure (like [[id:09fce9fb-f58f-43e3-937e-8b599afc04ef][=Functor=]]). But with =Applicative=, the function
we're applying is also embedded in some structure. Because the
function and the value it's being applied to both have structure, the
structures have to be smashed together.

class Functor f => Applicative f where
  pure :: a -> f a
  (<*>) :: f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
