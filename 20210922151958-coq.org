#+title: Coq tactic apply

* Difference between apply and [[id:eacb3f4e-f077-4db9-814d-89f270a51fbd][rewrite]]

The rewrite tactic is used to apply a known equality to either the
goal or a hypothesis in the context, replacing all occurrences of one
side by the other. The *apply* tactic uses a known implication (a
hypothesis from the context, a previously proved lemma, or a
constructor) to modify the proof state either backward (if the goal
matches the conclusion of the implication, in which case a subgoal
generated for each premise of the implication) or forward (if some
hypothesis matches the premise of the implication, in which this
hypothesis is replaced by the conclusion of the implication). If the
fact is itself an equality (i.e., an implication with no premises),
then either tactic can be used.
