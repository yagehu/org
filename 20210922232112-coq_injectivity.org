#+title: Coq injectivity

An injective function is a function that maps distinct elements; that
is $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ implies $x_1 = x_2$.

For every inductively defined type, all constructors are injective in
addition to being disjoint.

* Example

#+BEGIN_SRC coq
  Inductive nat : Type :=
    | O
    | S (n : nat).
#+END_SRC

Implicit in this definition are two additional facts:

- The constructor =S= is injective (or one-to-one). That is, if =S n =
  S m=, it must be that =n = m=.
- The constructors =O= and =S= are disjoint. That is, =O= is not equal
  to =S n= for any =n=.
